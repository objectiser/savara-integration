    <title>Service Oriented Analysis and Design</title>
    <para>
      At this point in the lifecycle, various activities would occur related to reviewing
      
      services (i.e. in a SOA Repository) and understanding whether existing services
      
      meet requirements, need to be modified, or whether new services need to be
      
      developed from scratch.
    </para>

      <title>Service Oriented Design</title>
      <para>
        In the current SAVARA tooling, the main functionality in the Service Oriented
        
        Design phase is the generation of BPMN (version 1) diagrams. These diagrams
        
        can be used as guidance for the development teams that are implementing the
        
        individual services.
      </para>
      <para>
        It is also possible to extend the generated BPMN (version 1) diagrams to include
        
        service logic. However it should be noted that changes to the choreography or
        
        BPMN diagrams will not be synchronized/merged. So changes in the choreography will
        
        not be checked for conformance against previously generated BPMN diagrams,
        
        and it will be necessary to generate new 'service contract' BPMN (version 1)
        
        diagrams to reflect changes in behaviour of a service within the updated
        
        choreography.
      </para>
      <para>
        In future versions of the SAVARA, based on BPMN2, it will be possible to
        
        formally check BPMN2 process models for conformance against a choreography
        
        model, and potentially synchronize differences in _externally
        
        observable behaviour_ between them.
      </para>
      <para>
        To generate a BPMN (version 1) diagram from a choreography, select the
        
        <emphasis role="italics">Export</emphasis>
        menu item associated with the choreography file,
        
        and select the
        <emphasis role="italics">Other-&gt;BPMN</emphasis>
        option.

      <para>
        Once the option has been selected, you will be asked to select the location
        
        where the generated BPMN diagrams should be stored. A diagram will be
        
        created containing all of the participants involved in the choreography in
        
        a single collaboration diagram.
      </para>
      <para>
        Select a folder that is located within a project in your Eclipse workspace.
        
        Once the folder has been chosen, the diagrams will be generated. To see
        
        them within the Eclipse project, you will need to
        <emphasis role="italics">refresh</emphasis>
        
        the relevant folder.
      </para>
      <para>
        The generated diagram will appear as two files, one contains the underlying
        
        BPMN model (i.e. the information about the tasks, control links, message links,
        
        etc.) and the other file contains the diagram information (i.e. node positions,
        
        etc). Double click on the file with the
        <code>.bpmn_diagram</code>
        
        suffix to view the diagram in the Eclipse BPMN editor.
