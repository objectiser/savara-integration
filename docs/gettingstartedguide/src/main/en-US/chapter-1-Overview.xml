      This is the Getting Started Guide for SAVARA. This guide starts with the
      
      installation instructions for the SAVARA tools and runtime modules.
    </para>
    <para>
      The remainder of the document is organised to reflect phases within the SAVARA
      
      Methodology, and how the current tools can be used in support of that methodology.
      
      The tools are still in development, and therefore not all phases will have tools,
      
      and the tools in some phases will not necessarily be complete.
