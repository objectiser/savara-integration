SAVARA 1.1.0.CR1
================

This is the first Candidate Release of version 1.1.0 of SAVARA.

The main new features within this release are service validators for
Web Services based on the jbossws-native stack (which includes BPEL
processes deployed in RiftSaw), and the first use of the TAP
(Testable Architecture Project) file as a means of representing artifacts
and their relationships, and being able to validate them.

SAVARA 1.0.0.CR1
================

This is the first Candidate Release of version 1.0.0 of SAVARA.

This release has resulted in a number of significant changes to the structure of the project.
Rather than have three separate distributions, we have consolidated all functionality into
one main distribution, and an Eclipse update site for the plugins.

The functionality associated with 'conversation aware' ESB actions has been removed from the
main distribution, and moved into a separate 'experimental' branch. This work has provided
some useful insight in to some possible features for the future, however the ideas are
not mature enough to remain as part of the first release.

NOTE: The annotation used for runtime validation has been renamed. Therefore if any choreographies
have been written, that include this annotation, you will need to update the annotation name and
the top level node of the XML fragment included in the annotation, from 'jbossesb' to 'validator'.
This can either be achieved by create new annotations and copying the destinations, or by
opening the .cdm files in a text editor, and updating the <semanticAnnotation> elements directly.

SAVARA Tools Eclipse 1.0-M1
===========================

This is the first milestone of version 1.0 of the SAVARA tools for Eclipse.

This distribution includes:
- early access work on checking the conformance of a choreography, defined using the pi4soa
choreography editor, against service implementations in BPEL and JBossESB "conversation aware"
actions
- generation of a choreography to BPEL services
- generation of a choreography to JBossESB services (using "conversation aware" ESB actions)
- generation of a choreography as a BPMN collaboration diagram
